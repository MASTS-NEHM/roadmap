# Context
Our oceans provide many life-sustaining benefits to coastal communities, including food, water, energy and employment, as well as affecting our weather and climate, including providing a sink for excess heat and carbon in the atmosphere. Management of the marine environment should consider many factors. Sustainable management of marine resources is central, as is stewardship of Scottish Coastal waters for future generations. A number of industries and communities need to co-exist. The environment, industries and communities need to be resilient to climate change and other shocks. Scottish coastal areas should be prosperous and content. Therefore, many pressures and outcomes must be considered in planning and projecting possible futures. Modelling can be a key tool in those projections.

## Economic
The marine sector currently represents approximately 3% of the Scottish Economy (accompanying table). Scotland has strong aspirations to participate in the growth of the Blue Economy, e.g. [Scotland's Marine Economy - The Scottish Government](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2020/10/scotlands-marine-economic-statistics-20182/documents/topic-sheet-number-99-v7/topic-sheet-number-99-v7/govscot%3Adocument/topic-sheet-number-99-v7.pdf)

At the same time, institutes within Scotland are researching the implications of a growing blue economy, e.g.
> The use of the oceans as a development space, and the decoupling of social and economic growth from environmental degradation, are at the centre of the scientific, education and commercial activities of the SAMS Blue Economy Research Area.

## Inherent
 
While the sustainable exploitation of resources contributes to the Scottish Economy, there is also an inherent value in the Scottish marine environment (natural assets and services) that might be enhanced or degraded by industries or external pressures. For example:
 
- The seas have a general amenity value that supports tourism and the quality of life in Scotland
- The seas host biodiversity and resilient ecosystems
- In common with other coastal systems, Scottish coastal waters are recognised as an important store of carbon (blue carbon).
 
Both global and regional factors threaten these natural assets and services.
 
Examples of global factors include climate change and in particular warming, acidification and de-oxygenation of the ocean. Acidification is a threat to biodiversity and to both living and geological stores of carbon.
 
Intensification of direct exploitation (e.g. “over-fishing”), displacement by new infrastructure and pollution can be global, but can at least be alleviated by local management practice.
 
An important tool of management in Scottish Coastal Waters is marine spatial planning including the designation of Marine Protected Areas ([https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/marine/marine-environment/mpanetwork](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/marine/marine-environment/mpanetwork)).

Spatial zoning in a fluid medium inevitably raises question about currents and dispersion and thus the connectivity of different sea areas. In this area hydrodynamic and related models and data are a key tool.
