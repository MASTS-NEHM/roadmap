## Biology and Biogeochemistry
Refer to ecosystem models e.g. ERSEM (European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model)

As part of EcoWatt2050 some work has been done on the interactions between physics from a baroclinic hydrodynamic model of NW shelf seas (NEMO-ERSEM  and FVCOM) and mobile marine species, including the joint distribution of predator-prey, at present and into the future. The parameters most effective in spatial correlation with distributions of species include bottom temperature, stratification and vertical velocity. Where ERSEM data on primary productivity are available, this is also a key parameter, but useful information can be derived from a physics model alone (Sadykova et al., 2017).

FVCOM-ERSEM code with FABM coupler was implemented in PML and recently applied at SAMS for the Scottish coastal waters test case study in Loch Ewe, nested into WeStCOMS domain under the NERC CAMPUS project at SAMS. This site was selected due to the availability of the longest plankton (phyto and zoo) observational dataset.
