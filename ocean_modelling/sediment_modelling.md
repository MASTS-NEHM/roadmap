## Sediment modelling
Sediment modelling is increasingly carried out as part of the requirement for ecosystem modelling in which fine sediment (suspended particulate matter, SPM) causes important changes in turbidity and hence light availability. Bottom sediment transport is important in the coastal zone in terms of coastal erosion and beach morphology, and how sediments affect the bottom roughness through grain size and bedforms.
