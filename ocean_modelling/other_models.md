# Other models

In general, model systems are now being developed, in which the core is a 3D baroclinic, hydrodynamic model, but there are also ancillary models, which may be more or less closely coupled with the hydrodynamic model. There are many interaction processes in which contributions from other dynamic models may be affected (either 1-way or 2-way) by processes in other models. Examples include the atmospheric forcing terms for heat or momentum, in which parametrisations of fluxes may include effects of the surface of the ocean, such as SST or waves in the formulation.
