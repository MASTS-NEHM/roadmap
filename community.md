## Regulatory/public organisations

The Scottish Government Marine Directorate (SGMD) is the lead marine management organisation in Scotland. It integrates core marine functions involving scientific research, compliance monitoring, policy and management of Scotland's seas through its three main divisions: Compliance, Policy and Science. Marine Scotland’s mission is to “manage Scotland's seas for prosperity and environmental sustainability” and has a vision of having “clean, healthy, safe, productive, biologically diverse marine and coastal environments, managed to meet the long term needs of nature and people”. The Science, Evidence and Digital Data Portofolio (SEDD) of the SGMD provides expert scientific and technical advice and services on issues relating to marine and freshwater fisheries, aquaculture, marine renewable energy, and the aquatic environment and its flora and fauna. SEDD also provides the evidence to support the policies and regulatory activities of the Scottish Government through a programme of monitoring and research. The SEDD Oceanography group routinely implements, runs and uses output from hydrodynamic models for a variety of marine science applications and research, and are the custodians of the [Scottish Shelf Model (SSM)](https://marine.gov.scot/themes/scottish-shelf-model).

The [Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)](https://www.sepa.org.uk/) is a non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government and is “Scotland’s principal environmental regulator, protecting and improving Scotland’s environment”. SEPAs role is to “make sure that the environment and human health are protected, to ensure that Scotland’s natural resources and services are used as sustainably as possible and contribute to sustainable economic growth”. SEPA have a small group of hydrodynamic modellers mainly focused on using hydrodynamic models to support the regulation of the Scottish aquaculture industry.

The [Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)](https://jncc.gov.uk/) is “the public body that advises the UK Government and devolved administrations on UK-wide and international nature conservation”. [NatureScot](https://www.nature.scot/) is a government agency that “promotes, cares for and improves Scotland’s natural heritage”.
Certain activities in the marine environment require a marine license, such as the deposit of substances or objects into the sea or onto the sea bed, the removal of substances or objects from the sea bed, construction, alteration and improvement works, dredging and the deposit or use of explosives.

## Aquaculture

Scotland has a diverse aquaculture industry, primarily focused on salmon production, but also including trout (and a range of other finfish species), mussels, oysters and other shellfish [The value of Aquaculture in Scotland](https://webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/3000/https://www.gov.scot/Resource/0052/00521407.pdf). Production of macroalgae is also practised on a small scale. The industry is an important provider of employment in rural areas, and has become an increasingly important component of the national economy. In 2015, aquaculture production was worth £670 m. Production in all species increased over the previous 10 years. The industry is supported by the government in its objective to sustainably expand production over the next decade, with targets seeking an approximate doubling in value/output [http://scottishsalmon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaculture-growth-to-2030.pdf](http://scottishsalmon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaculture-growth-to-2030.pdf).

However, expansion cannot continue without limit. The majority of the most suitable locations for siting farms (sheltered fjordic environments) are now occupied. The industry has also come under mounting pressure in respect of its environmental impacts and animal welfare (Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee 2018; Tett et al. 2018). Salmon aquaculture sites in particular are subject to regulation on benthic (seabed) impacts, in terms of organic enrichment and impacts of the chemicals used to treat sea lice (SEPA 2019a). Chemical treatments in particular are likely to be phased out in the near future (***SEPA REF?***), placing increased reliance on alternatives. More recently, operators seeking consent to develop or expand sites are required to produce Environmental Management Plans, which outline likely interactions with neighbouring operations and sensitive environmental features that are found nearby (***POLICY REF on this?***). 

The environmental impacts of aquaculture sites are a key concern of local/district river and fisheries trusts/boards (overseen by Fisheries Management Scotland), and local community groups. 

## Marine fisheries
Wild harvest macroalgae e.g. ascophyllum on Hebrides.

Industry: offshore renewable constructors and investors, consulting companies (SMRU Consulting, DHI?, ABPmer, EDF, Sustainable Marine Energy?)
	Conservation groups: e.g. Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, COAST (Community of Arran Seabed Trust)

Transport - acoustics, invasive species.

## Offshore Renewable Energy
European Marine Energy Centre, Scottish Renewables, Meygen, Nova, Orbital ….

Offshore wind farms are rapidly becoming a large part of the energy generation sector in Scotland. Tidal energy and wave energy are less developed but Scotlnd is a leader in testing, industries and regulation related to these. 

Offshore wind farms can interact with the marine environment through alteration of wind stresses and interference of their foundations with currents. Scouring and displacement or introduction of habitat	are fundamental processes acting on marine ecosystems. The level of interaction of a single wind turbine on marine systems is probably quite low, but since many GigaWatts of capacity is being installed, the total effect may be very substantial.	

Though the wave and tidal energy industries are less developed, the co-dependence of these industries with marine science and technology is very strong and a large amount of interaction is necessary. Areas of interest include resource and resource interaction with energy capture, and interactions between marine ecosystems and infrastructure.
